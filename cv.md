**First of all, my goal is my own development with the prospect of further career growth and the development of professional skills.  I am strong at multitasking, easy to learn, communicating with people and stress tolerance.  I started out in sales, but quickly realized that I was more interested in building a product than selling it.  Therefore, I went to work, in one company, where I worked as a team leader for a year.  Under my control, 20 employees worked, who consistently completed their tasks and closed deadlines.  Directly my task was to control the implementation of the plan by employees.  All my free time I studied programming and, in my opinion, I succeeded quite well in this**

*At first I did Python, a little later I realized that I was not mistaken when I realized that I was better at creating a product, so I started learning JavaScript*

**Bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, front-end development courses from MyWay**
